# Loading and Working with the Data

The notebooks in this folder are end-to-end projects to help you with some common tasks when using this data.

* [I. Introduction](https://github.com/marketpsych/marketpsych/blob/main/notebooks/i_introduction.ipynb)  
    This will walk you through loading, visualizing and even downloading slices of the dataset.

* [II. Selection](https://github.com/marketpsych/marketpsych/blob/main/notebooks/ii_selection.ipynb)  
    This shows how to load only a selection of the assets available in each asset class.

* [III. Aggregation](https://github.com/marketpsych/marketpsych/blob/main/notebooks/iii_aggregation.ipynb)  
    In many situations you may want to aggregate the data in longer time-windows (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.). This notebook demonstrates the two main options for aggregating daily data into a bespoke timeframe.

* [IV. Trading](https://github.com/marketpsych/marketpsych/blob/main/notebooks/iv_trading.ipynb)  
    Sentiment can be a powerful addition to a quant's toolkit. This notebook gives an example about using the Refinitiv MarketPsych Analytics as features in a quant model for predicting changes in asset prices.
