# MarketPsych: Power of minds over markets

MarketPsych produces the global standard in financial sentiment and ESG data from the news and social media information flow. We serve global funds, corporations, banks and brokerages in over 25 countries. Our products are distributed exclusively, and in partnership, with [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/en), a global provider of financial market data and infrastructure.

MarketPsych's proprietary NLP engine evaluates thousands of market moving themes, which are further aggregated into scores. The scores form time-series that are updated every 60 seconds. Each score represents the scale and direction of the media focus on complex themes, including sentiments, sustainability and price. They can be translated directly into spreadsheets or charts that can be monitored by traders, risk managers or analysts â€“ or they can be plugged straight into your algorithms for low frequency or longer-term asset allocation or sector rotation decisions.
